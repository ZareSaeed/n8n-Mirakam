# üìÑ BPMS Proposal Generator

This project contains a series of n8n workflows designed to automate the creation of detailed, personalized, and data-driven sales proposals for the ICAN BPMS product suite.

## üéØ The Problem
Manually creating comprehensive sales proposals is a time-intensive process. It requires gathering client-specific information, researching their industry, referencing internal product documentation, and formatting it all into a consistent, professional document. This manual approach is slow, prone to inconsistency, and doesn't scale well.

## ‚ú® The Solution
This workflow automates the entire proposal generation process. It acts as a central engine that consolidates multiple data sources‚Äîclient requirements, web research, internal knowledge bases‚Äîand uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a complete, multi-section proposal in HTML format.

The core logic ensures that every proposal is not only generated quickly but is also highly tailored to the prospective client's unique needs and industry context.

## üß© Helper Sub-Workflows

The main proposal generator relies on helper sub-workflows for specific data enrichment tasks. These helpers must be imported and activated in your n8n instance for the main workflow to function correctly.

*   **[AiWebCrawler](./Helpers%20(Sub-Workflows)/AiWebCrawler/)**: Scrapes a client's website to extract relevant information (like mission, services, and team) for deep personalization.
*   **[Industry Challenges Analyzer](./Helpers%20(Sub-Workflows)/Industry%20Challenges%20Analyzer/)**: Provides context on common challenges and pain points within a client's specific industry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technology
*   **Automation:** n8n (with sub-workflow execution)
*   **AI/LLM:** AvaCloud API (OpenAI Compatible)
*   **Data Format:** JSON, HTML
*   **Data Enrichment:** Web Scraping, Google Sheets
